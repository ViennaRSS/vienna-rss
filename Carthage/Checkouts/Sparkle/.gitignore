# With Carthage, if Sparkle is included as a Git submodule (e.g. with the
# --use-submodules option), the main module's .gitignore can't reach all the
# way inside the submodule to ignore the added Carthage/Build symlink, and Git
# keeps complaining about untracked changes in the submodule forever, which
# is very annoying. To avoid that issue, ignore here in Sparkle instead.
