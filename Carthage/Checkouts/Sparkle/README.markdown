Secure and reliable software update framework for Cocoa developers.

This branch is the production ready, battle-tested version of Sparkle used by thousands of Mac apps.
The upcoming Sparkle 2 (currently in beta) can be found in the [2.x branch](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/tree/2.x).

## Features

* Seamless. There's no mention of Sparkle; your icons and app name are used.
* Secure. Updates are verified using EdDSA signatures and Apple Code Signing.
* Fast. Supports delta updates which only patch files that have changed.
* Easy to install. Sparkle requires no code in your app, and only needs static files on a web server.
* Supports bundles, preference panes, plugins, and other non-.app software. Can install .pkg files for more complicated products.
* Handles permissions, quarantine and automatically asks for authentication if needed.
* Uses RSS-based appcasts for release information. Appcasts are a de-facto standard supported by 3rd party update-tracking programs and websites.
* Stays hidden until second launch for better first impressions.
* Truly self-updating — the user can choose to automatically download and install all updates in the background.
* Ability to mark updates as critical.
* Progress and status notifications for the host app.

## Requirements

* Runtime: macOS 10.7 or greater
* Build: Xcode 9 and 10.11 SDK or greater
* HTTPS server for serving updates (see [App Transport Security](http://sparkle-project.org/documentation/app-transport-security/))
* No sandboxing. Sparkle 1.x can't update sandboxed apps. [Sparkle 2.x](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/tree/2.x) can.

## Usage

See [getting started guide](https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/). No code is necessary, but a bit of Xcode configuration is required.

## Development

This repository uses git submodules, and will not build unless you clone recursively. Also, GitHub-provided ZIP/tar archives are broken due to GitHub not supporting git submodules properly.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle

### Troubleshooting

  * Please check **Console.app**. Sparkle prints detailed information there about all problems it encounters. It often also suggests solutions to the problems, so please read Sparkle's log messages carefully.

  * Use the `generate_appcast` tool which creates appcast files, correct signatures, and delta updates automatically.

  * Make sure the URL specified in [`SUFeedURL`](https://sparkle-project.org/documentation/customization/) is valid (typos/404s are a common error!), and that it uses modern TLS ([test it](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)).

  * Delete your app's preferences (in `~/Library/Preferences/<your bundle id>`) if you've set another feed URL programmatically via Sparkle's Objective-C interface.

### API symbols

Sparkle is built with `-fvisibility=hidden -fvisibility-inlines-hidden` which means no symbols are exported by default.
If you are adding a symbol to the public API you must decorate the declaration with the `SU_EXPORT` macro (grep the source code for examples).

### Building the distribution package

`cd` to the root of the Sparkle source tree and run `make release`. Sparkle-*VERSION*.tar.bz2 will be created in a temporary directory and revealed in Finder after the build has completed.

Alternatively, build the Distribution scheme in the Xcode UI.
