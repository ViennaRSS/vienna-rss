Vienna source code?</a></h2>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.vienna-rss.org/vienna_dev.php">Development page</a> for 
instructions for getting the source code for Vienna. The source code is 
freely available if you're interested in learning how Vienna works, if 
you want to build your own copy of Vienna from scratch on your own 
machine or if you want to borrow portions for inclusion in your own

<h2><a name="I_found_a_problem_with_Vienna._How_do_I_report_it">I found 
a problem with Vienna. How do I report it?</a></h2>
<p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:vienna-rss-help@lists.sourceforge.net">Vienna Help</a> or post a message over in the <a href="http://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewforum.php?f=18">
Support forum</a> and somebody will 
investigate. Provide as much information about the problem as you can 
including: the build of Vienna (obtained from the About Vienna panel), 
repro steps and what you expected to happen. There is a sticky note in
the forum with tips on how to write a good bug report.</p>

<p>Make sure you're always running the most recent build of Vienna. The 
Check for Updates command will report if there's a newer build available 
than the one you have.</p>
<p>Fixes for bugs take priority over new features so if your problem is 
confirmed to be a bug with high impact and no simple workaround then 
I'll look at making a fix available as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
<h2><a name="How_do_I_create_my_own_styles">How do I create my own 
styles?</a></h2>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.vienna-rss.org/vienna_styles.php">Custom Styles page</a> for 
instructions.</p>
<h2><a name="How_do_I_create_my_own_scripts">How do I create my own 
scripts?</a></h2>

<p>Vienna's scripts are written using AppleScript. See the
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/resources.html">
Apple resource page</a> for more details.</p>
<p>One way to get started is to download one of the existing scripts 
from the <a href="http://www.vienna-rss.org/vienna_files.php">Vienna Downloads page</a> and view 
it in the AppleScript editor.</p>

<p>To submit your own script, send it to
<a href="mailto:steve@opencommunity.co.uk">steve@opencommunity.co.uk</a> 
and after it has been reviewed, it will be made available on the 
Downloads page.</p>
<h2>
<a name="How_can_I_see_what_happened_when_my_subscriptions_are_refreshed">
How can I see what happened when my subscriptions are refreshed?</a></h2>
<p>Open the Activity Window from the Window menu. The activity window 
shows all subscriptions and the status of the last time they were 
refreshed in that session. The bottom of the activity window shows more 
details include the HTTP headers and may be useful for debugging. (If 
the details pane is not visible, grab the split bar at the bottom of the 
Activity Window and drag it up to uncover the pane).</p>
<h2><a name="How_do_I_move_my_Vienna_database_to_another_folder">How do 
I move my Vienna database to another folder?</a></h2>

<p>By default, your Vienna database is the messages.db file which is 
located at ~/Library/Application Support/Vienna. You can move this to 
another folder if you wish. The following steps show how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shut down Vienna.</li>
<li>Open a console window and enter:<br>
<br>
<font face="Courier New">defaults write uk.co.opencommunity.vienna2 
&quot;DefaultDatabase&quot; '&lt;path to new messages.db&gt;'</font><br>

<br>
where &lt;path to new messages.db&gt; is the name of the folder that 
contains the messages.db file. The path itself should have the 
messages.db filename at the end. For example:<br>
<br>
<font face="Courier New">defaults write uk.co.opencommunity.vienna2 
&quot;DefaultDatabase&quot; '/Users/steve/mydata/messages.db'</font><br>
</li>

<li>Restart Vienna.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
<a name="One_of_my_subscriptions_reports_Error_parsing_XML_data_in_feed._What_does_this_mean">
One of my subscriptions reports &quot;Error parsing XML data in feed&quot;. What 
does this mean?</a></h2>
<p>It means that Vienna got a feed back from the subscription that it 
couldn't interpret. There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ol>
<li>The URL of the feed may not be pointing to an RSS or Atom feed 
but to a web page. Check the URL of the offending feed carefully.</li>
<li>The feed itself may contain malformed XML. Some subscriptions 
make a mistake in putting together the XML that makes up the feed 
and Vienna cannot interpret malformed XML. Use the Validate Feed 
command on the File menu to see if this is the case. Unfortunately 
you cannot do much about this in Vienna except wait for the feed 
itself to be corrected by the site.</li>
<li>The feed may be incomplete. If the refresh was interrupted then 
the XML data will be incomplete and will appear malformed in Vienna. 
A second refresh may correct this problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>If none of the above explain the problem, post a message on the 
support forum with the URL of the feed exhibiting the problem. </p>
<h2>

<a name="Is_there_a_shortcut_key_for_going_to_the_next_article_marking_read_etc_">
Is there a shortcut key for going to the next article, marking read, 
etc?</a></h2>
<p>Probably. There are single key equivalents for some of the menu 
commands such as:</p>
<p>Spacebar - goes to the next unread article. If the current article is 
several pages long, it will scroll through that article first. If you're 
at the end of the current article it will then go to the next unread 
article. By contrast the Next Unread command (Cmd+U) always goes 
straight to the next unread article.</p>
<p>R - marks the current article read if it is unread, or unread if it 
is read.</p>
<p>F - flags the current article if it isn't already flagged, or removes 
the existing flag if it is not.</p>

<p>Look in the Vienna Help file for more shortcuts.</p>

<h2><a name="What_do_the_green_dots_mean_in_the_list_of_articles">What do
the green dots mean in the list of articles?</a></h2>
<p>The blue dots are for new articles, and the green dots are for updated articles:
articles whose text has changed since they were last downloaded.</p>

<h2><a name="How_do_I_use_Auto_Expire_and_what_does_it_do">How do I use 
Auto Expire and what does it do?</a></h2>
<p>Auto-expire moves articles older than a certain number of days to the 
Trash folder. It allows you to keep your folders manageable by only 
retaining articles that are recent. The auto-expire runs both when 
Vienna starts and after you have refreshed any subscriptions. To control 
the age of articles to auto-expire, change the
&quot;Move articles to Trash&quot; option in Preferences.</p>
<p>Auto-expire will NOT remove unread or flagged articles. It assumes 
that you haven't read these articles and thus leaves them alone.</p>
<h2><a name="How_do_I_request_an_enhancement_in_Vienna">How do I request 
an enhancement in Vienna?</a></h2>

<p>Post a message over at the
<a href="http://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewforum.php?f=18">support forum</a>. All 
requested enhancements are logged in the TODO file that is included with 
the source code as a guidance for future developers.</p>
