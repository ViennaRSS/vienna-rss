  Vienna</span>
  <p>Vienna is an application that allows you to read RSS or Atom
  news feeds on your Mac OSX computer. It automates the job of
  retrieving news articles from all subscribed feeds and storing
  them in a local database for reading off-line. It provides
  features that allow you to search feeds for keywords or phrases,
  tag articles with a flag for future reference and organise
  related feeds together under groups. You can create smart folders
  that make it easy to dynamically retrieve and view all articles
  in the database that match a search criteria. The built-in web
  browser allows you to go to the articles web page or view links
  in the article directly in Vienna in separate tabs.</p>
  <p>Vienna is designed to be simple and easy to use. A clean,
  uncluttered, interface maximises the space for articles and just
  a few controls are needed to perform the most common actions in
  the user interface.</p><b>Getting Started</b>
  <p>If this is the first time that you have used Vienna then it
  will have created a new database for you and added some sample
  news subscriptions. So go ahead and press Command+T or choose
  Refresh All Subscriptions from the File menu to grab the latest
  articles from those subscriptions.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, subscribe to your own news feeds. There are
  various ways to find feeds. When browsing the web, look out for
  the <img src="images/rssfeed.gif" alt="RSS feed icon" /> or XML
  icons indicating that the page has a feed associated with it.
  Alternatively almost all online blogging services such as
  LiveJournal or Blogger provide RSS feeds as an alternative to
  reading the postings online.</p>
  <p>If you know the user name of a blogger on LiveJournal,
  Blogger, MSN Spaces or Xanga then Vienna makes it easier to
  subscribe to their news feed. Start by pressing Command+N or from
  the File menu, choose the New Subscription command. In the
  "Create a new RSS subscription" panel, pick the blogging service
  from the drop down list and enter the user name in the input
  field below. Then choose Subscribe and Vienna will add the
  subscription to the folder list. If you are connected to the
  internet at the time, it will also immediately start collecting
  articles from the feed.</p>
  <p>Normally you need to manually tell Vienna when to refresh all
  your subscriptions. However you can opt to ask Vienna to
  automatically refresh at time intervals. In the General section
  of the Preferences, pick the desired time interval from the drop
  down list next to 'Check for new articles'. Vienna needs to be
  running for it to automatically refresh subscriptions.</p>
  <p>To read articles, press the Spacebar to skip to the next
  unread article in any subscription. Each article is marked as
  read automatically after a short delay. If you prefer to wait
  until you move to the next unread article before the current one
  is marked read you can adjust the behaviour in the General tab of
  the Preferences. To mark an article as unread again, choose the
  Mark Unread command from the Article menu or simply press the 'R'
  key.</p>
  <p>Finally, you can view the article web page or any web page
  links in an article within Vienna. By default clicking on a web
  link within Vienna will open the web page in a new tab. Vienna
  provides a lot of basic web browsing support itself but there may
  be times when you will prefer to open links in your default web
  browser. If you prefer to view all web pages outside of Vienna
  then enable the 'Open links in external browser' option in the
  General section of the Preferences. However if you prefer to view
  the current link or page in your external browser, right click on
  the page and choose the "Open Link in XXX" or "Open Page in XXX"
  option where XXX will be the name of your default browser.</p>
  <p>Once you've got comfortable using Vienna, go ahead and explore
  the various options. You can change the style in which the
  articles are displayed through the Style drop down list in the
  View menu. You can find many more custom styles at the Downloads
  page on the Vienna web site along with custom scripts that allow
  you to integrate Vienna with other applications on your machine.
  Or experiment with smart folders to organise articles according
  to criteria based on the contents of each article. For example,
  you can easily set up a smart folder to group together all
  articles that mention "Joss Whedon" and "Firefly" to find
  references to the Firefly cult series or the spin-off movie.</p>
