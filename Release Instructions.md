Instructions for building and uploading Vienna binaries to Sourceforge and Bintray

## One time setup step: ##

 -	To ensure that releases are properly codesigned make sure that you have properly edited `Scripts/Resources/CS-ID.xcconfig` for your setup.
    `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY` should be the name of your certificate as it is stored in Keychain,
    `PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` should be the location of the private DSA key used by Sparkle,
    `CODE_SIGN_REQUIREMENTS_PATH` should generally remain at its default value.

## Tag Formatting ##

Tags should be in one of the following formats:

 -	Normal release: (3.0.0)

		v/3.0.0

 -	Beta release (Second beta for 3.0.0)

		v/3.0.0_beta2

 -	Release candidate (first for 3.0.0)

		v/3.0.0_rc1

## Steps to release Vienna: ##

 1.	Review all recent code changes and make sure you should not change `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` in the project configuration in order to protect users whose machines do not match minimum OS X requirements from a counter-productive "upgrade".
 2.	Make sure that the "CHANGES" file is up to date.
 3.	Copy the most recent part of "CHANGES" in a new text document and process it with Markdown to get a new "notes.html".
 4.	Commit anything unstaged (on `master` branch if you are releasing a beta or on `stable` branch if you are doing a normal release).
 5.	Make a new tag using `git tag -s` _tagname_, respecting the above mentioned convention (if you do not have a gpg key, you can use `git tag -a` instead).
 6.	Run `make clean`.
 7.	Run `make release`. Check the last displayed messages to ensure yourself that the application is correctly signed.
 8.	Push the tag to ViennaRSS' repository at Github (`git push --tags ViennaRSS master` or `git push --tags ViennaRSS stable`, accordingly).
 9.	Upload the contents of `Deployment/Uploads` (found in the build directory) using the following steps.
  (Note: I'm using Vienna 3.3.0_beta4, 3.3.0_rc1 and 3.3.0 as examples here.)

### On Github:

   1. Go to Vienna's releases page on Github : <https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/releases>
   2. Choose "Draft a new release", type the tag name (`v/3.3.0_beta4`), a description ("Vienna 3.3.0 Beta 4"). Upload the `Vienna3.3.0_beta4.tgz` file.
   3. For beta and release candidates, check the "This is a prerelease" box.
   4. Click the "Publish" button.
   5. Verify the uploaded file: download it, uncompress it and check that it runs OK.

### On Bintray.com:
	
   6. Log in and go to <https://bintray.com/viennarss/vienna-rss/vienna-rss/view>
   7. Choose "New version".
   8. Fill the name ("3.3.0Beta4"), the description from the version notes, then click "Create version". Add the VCS tag (`v/3.3.0_beta4`) and update.
   9. Check the version (at <https://bintray.com/viennarss/vienna-rss/vienna-rss/3.3.0Beta4>), click "Upload this versionâ€™s files (...) via the UI" to go to <https://bintray.com/viennarss/vienna-rss/vienna-rss/3.3.0Beta4/upload> and upload the two .tgz files (whose name should be like `Vienna3.3.0_beta4.tgz` and `Vienna3.3.0_beta4.5b272a6-dSYM.tgz`).
   10. Click "Save the changes", then click "Publish".
   11. Go back to the files list (<https://bintray.com/viennarss/vienna-rss/vienna-rss/3.3.0Beta4/#files>), select the binary ("Vienna3.3.0_beta4.tgz") and choose "Show in download list" in the contextual menu.

### On Sourceforge.net:

   12. Check that the SourceForge Downloads page for Vienna at <https://sourceforge.net/projects/vienna-rss/files/> got the new files.
   13. For stable releases only : from the Sourceforge site, edit the "Properties" of "Vienna3.3.0.tgz" (be careful to select the binary and not the code source file !) and set it as default download for Mac OS X. Don't do this for beta releases!

### On viennarss.github.io

   14. Upload `changelog_beta.xml` (or `changelog_rc.xml` or `changelog.xml` accordingly) and the `noteson3.3.0_beta4.html` file in the sparkle_files directory
   15. If you upload a release candidate, change `changelog_beta.xml` to be a copy of the new `changelog_rc.xml` ; and if you upload a release, change `changelog_rc.xml` to be a copy of the new `changelog.xml`
   16. Run the previous version of Vienna, and make sure that the Sparkle update mechanism works correctly to display and download the latest version. After updating, check again to make sure Sparkle is showing that you have the latest version.

### On Brew Cask

17. __For stable releases only :__ follow the steps listed below, adapted from the [Brew Cask Wiki](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-a-cask):

>We have a [script](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/tiny-scripts/blob/master/cask-repair) that will ask for the new version number, and take care of updating the Cask file and submitting a pull request to homebrew-cask:

```bash
# install and setup script - only needed once
brew install vitorgalvao/tiny-scripts/cask-repair
cask-repair --help

# fork homebrew-cask to your account - only needed once
cd "$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew-cask/Casks"
git config --local hub.protocol ssh
hub fork

# use to update <outdated_cask>
outdated_cask='vienna'
github_user='your_github_username'
cd "$(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew-cask/Casks"
cask-repair --pull origin --push $github_user $outdated_cask
```

Finally, consider posting an announcement of the new release on the CocoaForge Vienna forum at <http://forums.cocoaforge.com/viewforum.php?f=18> and/or <http://vienna-rss.com>.
