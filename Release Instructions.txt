## One time setup step: ##

 -	To ensure that releases are properly codesigned make sure that you have properly edited `configs/CS-ID.xcconfig` for your setup.
    CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY should be the name of your certificate as it is stored in Keychain, and
    CODE_SIGN_RESOURCE_RULE should generally point to ResourceRules.plist in MacOSX.platform in Xcode.

## Tag Formatting ##

Tags should be in one of the following formats:
 -	Normal release: (3.0.0)

		v/3.0.0
 -	Beta release (Second beta for 3.0.0)

		v/3.0.0_beta2
 -	Release candidate (first for 3.0.0)

		v/3.0.0_rc1

## Steps to release Vienna: ##

 1.	Make sure `CHANGES` is up to date.
 2.	Copy the most recent part of `CHANGES` in a new text document and process it with Markdown to get a new `notes.html`.
 3.	Make a new tag using `git tag -s` (if you do not have a gpg key you can use `git tag -a` instead).
 4.	Run `make clean`.
 5.	Run `make release`.
 6.	Upload the contents of `Deployment/Uploads` (found in the build directory).
