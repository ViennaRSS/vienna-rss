# Contributing to Vienna

## Writing code

The current version of Vienna requires Xcode 7 and Mac OS X 10.11 SDK. We will be officially moving to Xcode 8 and macOS Sierra SDK once it has been released. Currently the Unit Tests require Xcode 8 and Swift 3.

Vienna uses [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) for managing dependencies. When building, make sure to always open the Xcode workspace `Viennna.xcworkspace` instead of a project file.

You should have a basic knowledge of Git and read this [advice on workflow](https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/wiki/Good-manners-with-Git).

As a starting point, search for any [issues with the *help-wanted* label](https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahelp-wanted).

Please let us know what you are working on by posting an issue on Vienna's github and assigning it to yourself.
