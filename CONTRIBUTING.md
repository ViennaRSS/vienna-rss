# Contributing to Vienna

## Writing code

The current version of Vienna requires Xcode 9 and the macOS 10.13 SDK. Most of Vienna is made with Objective-C, but some newer code is being created in Swift 4. We welcome both Objective-C and Swift contributions.

Vienna uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) for managing dependencies. When building, make sure to always open the Xcode workspace `Viennna.xcworkspace` instead of a project file.

You should have a basic knowledge of Git and read this [suggested workflow](https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/wiki/Good-manners-with-Git).

As a starting point, search for any [issues with the *help-wanted* label](https://github.com/ViennaRSS/vienna-rss/labels/help%20wanted).

Please let us know what you are working on by posting an issue on Vienna's github and assigning it to yourself.
