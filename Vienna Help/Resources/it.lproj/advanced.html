  Settings</span>
  <p>The Advanced section of the Preferences provides options to
  change very specific settings in Vienna that are not essential
  for normal use but may resolve some issues as advised by the
  support forum. This page details the advanced settings and their
  function.</p>
  <h2><b>Enable JavaScript in internal browser</b></h2>
  <p>Enables or disables support for JavaScript scripting in the
  Vienna internal browser. By default this is enabled. By turning
  this setting off, JavaScript code on web pages will not be
  allowed to run. This may resolve problems with pages that use
  scripting to pop up windows or other unexpected behaviour but
  turning the setting off may also cause some web pages to appear
  incomplete or fail to function correctly.</p>
