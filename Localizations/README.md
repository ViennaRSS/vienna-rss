# Localizations

This folder should contain the most-recent XLIFF files. These files can be imported into the Xcode project by using the [update_localizations.rb](../Scripts/update_localizations.rb) script.

Crowdin will monitor changes to [en.xliff](en.xliff) and submit matching versions of the other XLIFF files.
